Greetings. This is my very first system developed by myself during my internship. Its an expiry management system by using CRUD as its basis. It's a web-based system.

How it's suppose to work:
1) User will receive a product from supplier.
2) User will key-in details of said product in the system. (Product number, qty, receive and expiry date)
3) To sell(supply) product to client, user had to key in the product's details (Product number, qty, supply and expiry date)
4) there will be a quantity counting (function is still not created)
5) this system will give out warning when the product is less than one month before expiry. An alert will trigger if the product is expired.
6) Hold part list is reserve for products that are already expired by may still be used or if the product is in KIV
7) Will auto match product description to product number when it is key-in to the system. (Function not yet created)
8) probably requres edit and delete capabilities that affects product quantity (not yet created)


*Do note that I'm still a beginner in programming...
